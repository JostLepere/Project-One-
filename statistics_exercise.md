 What will be the sum of deviations of individual data points from their mean ? <br />

 Solution: Variance = 59.2 <br />
           Mean = 12.8 <br />
           Standart Deviation s=7.69 <br />
<br />
<br />

 <br />
A) Standard Deviation is robust to outliers B) Standard Deviation will increase with the introduction of outliers. C) Standard Deviation will decrease with the introduction of outliers. D) Can not be determined.<br />
Solution (guess): B?

3. Suppose the below positively skewed distribution has a median of 30, which of the following statement is true? <br />
<br />
A) Mean is greater than 30 <br />
B) Mean is less than 30 <br />
C) Mode is greater than 30 <br />
D) Mode is less than 30 <br />
E) Both A and D <br /> 
F) Both B and C <br />

Solution F
<br />
<br />
4. Which value can be the possible value for the median of the below distribution? a)40 b)26 c)16 d)50? 
   Solution?  [36,54,69,82,55,43,25,22,17]  Why is it not 55?
<br />
 5. What is the shape of the distribution?
<br />

<br />
7. IF Y axis represents the number of individuals and X axis - salary of the individual in thousands. How many individuals have salary less than 10 thousands?
   Solution - 12+ 24 = 36k 
<br />
8. We have a set of positive numbers. If a single value of the set is altered what must change? A)MEAN B) Median C) Mode D) All
   Solution ( Guess): A

9. The chart shows hourly consultancy rate of 10 people. Calculate standart deviation. 

 S     E   Sum
 25    3    75
 40    2    80
 35    1    35
 50    4   200

 Solution: Range: 200-35=165   Variance:((165-75))**2 + (165-80)**2 + (165-35)**2 + (165-200)) / (4-1)= 10730   Standart deviation = square root of variance= 103.59 <br />
 <br />
