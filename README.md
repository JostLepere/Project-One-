### Project-One- This is my first project EVER ###

#This is a short summary for me personally on what I want to remeber after the first week of learning python with @codeacademyberlin

The list of most important commands, functions and general things to keep in mind is far from complete, just for me to remember. 


##Operators##

Operator	  Name	                Description
a + b	      Addition	            Sum of a and b
a - b	      Subtraction	          Difference of a and b
a * b	      Multiplication	      Product of a and b
a / b	      True division	        Quotient of a and b
a // b	    Floor division	      Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts
a % b	      Modulus	              Integer remainder after division of a by b
a ** b	    Exponentiation	      a raised to the power of b
-a	        Negation	            The negative of a

Operators are main commands to use in functions, like using a calculator



##bools##

Bools are binary, yes or no, true or false statements e.g. like in the example here:

# bools examples
#######
team1_pts = 110
team2_pts = 120
