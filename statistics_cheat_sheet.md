###Basic statistics###

This sheet collects the basic elements of statistics 
<br />
We are talking about two types of statistics - *Descriptive* and *Inferential* <br />
<br />
<br />
For the descriptive statistics, we distinguish between four categories: <br />
  a) Measures of Frequency ( Count, Percent, Frequency ) <br />
     -> This allows us to answer questions like: - how man? / proportion or scale <br />
  b) Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode) <br />
     -> Mean = Average <br /> 
     -> Median = deviding plot in two equal sides. <br />
     -> Mode <br />
  c) Measures of variation (Range, Variance, Standart deviation)<br />
     -> Range measure the difference between highest lowest value <br />
     -> Variance and standart deviation measures the difference between observed score and mean value <br />
        Standard deviation = Square root of Variance <br />
  d) Measures of relative position (Percentile, quartile) <br />
  <br />
  <br />
